## #30dayMapChallenge 
What is the [30dayMapChallenge](https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge)?

**My results `r emo::ji("tada")`**

The idea is to make 30 maps from each day from 1st Nov to 30th Nov 2020. I hope to get about half done - so 15 maps.

I want to use this challenge to play around with different R packages for geospatial data and try out different ways of interactive visualizations.

## Day 1: Points

**Amount of cars in XHain mapped as points onto streets**

There are 80.808 cars registered in Berlin (2017). 

If all cars would start driving at the same time - it'd get pretty crowded `r emo::ji("car")``r emo::ji("car")` `r emo::ji("car")`

The polygon of the streets are derived as a 'negative' from the official blocks provided by the Geoportal Berlin. Points to represent cars are sampled randomly within the polygon.

[R source code](R/day1.R)

**Data:**

- [Amount of cars via kleine Anfragen](https://s3.kleine-anfragen.de/ka-prod/be/18/20848.pdf)
- [Polygon of streets derived from Geoportal Berlin 'Blockkarte 1:5000 (ISU5)'](https://fbinter.stadt-berlin.de/fb/index.jsp?loginkey=zoomStart&mapId=ISU5@senstadt&bbox=387452,5818178,395140,5822472)

**Tools & Packages:**

- [*sf*](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) and [*leaflet*](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) R package
